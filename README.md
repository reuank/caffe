# Caffe

## My comments on the installation process of Caffe (CPU only) on MacOS 10.15.1 with Homebrew, Python 3.7.5 and OpenCV 4.1.2 

I followed this guide and made a few changes to fit my version needs: [https://www.dazhuanlan.com/2019/08/15/5d5514f5efcdc/](https://www.dazhuanlan.com/2019/08/15/5d5514f5efcdc/)

- My changes to `Makefile.config` and `include/caffe/ommon.hpp` are already committed here

- If the pre-make step fails fails in the build folder due to a `vecLib` related Error, edit `CMakeCache.txt` and set `vecLib_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/Accelerate.framework/Versions/Current/Frameworks/vecLib.framework/Headers`

- My edits to `CMakeCache.txt` after running `cmake` for premake:

```
//Path to a program.
PYTHON_EXECUTABLE:FILEPATH=/usr/local/bin/python3

//Path to a file.
PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=/usr/local/Cellar/python/3.7.5/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/include/python3.7m

//Path to a library.
PYTHON_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/usr/local/Cellar/python/3.7.5/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/libpython3.7m.dylib

//Flags used by the CXX compiler during all build types.
CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS:STRING=-std=c++11
  
//Boost python library (release)
Boost_PYTHON_LIBRARY_RELEASE:FILEPATH=/usr/local/Cellar/boost-python3/1.71.0_1/lib/libboost_python37-mt.dylib
  
//Build Caffe without CUDA support
CPU_ONLY:BOOL=ON
```

- For `sudo make test` not to fail (see [this](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/issues/6491#issuecomment-491557179)), I need to change

```
ifeq ($(OSX), 1)
	CXX := /usr/bin/clang++
```

into

```
ifeq ($(OSX), 1)
	CXX := /usr/bin/clang++ -std=c++11
```
